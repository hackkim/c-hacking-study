# 🛡️ Pwnable & Reverse Engineering Study Journey

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository documents my personal study journey in **Pwnable Hacking** and **Reverse Engineering**. 

I'm learning systematically with the help of ChatGPT and Claude AI, focusing on hands-on practice to develop real hacking techniques and security analysis skills.

## 🎯 Study Goals

- **C/C++** - Master memory management and low-level programming
- **Python** - Exploit development and automation scripting
- **Assembly** - Core foundation for binary analysis and reverse engineering
- **Binary Exploitation** - Buffer overflows, ROP, Heap exploits, etc.
- **Reverse Engineering** - Malware analysis, program structure understanding
